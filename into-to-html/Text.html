  <p class="vedio-discription">US President-elect Donald Trump has requested the Supreme Court to delay the enforcement of a law that could either ban TikTok or force its sale by January 19, 2025. 
    Arguing for more time, Trump suggested that his incoming administration should have the opportunity to resolve the matter politically.
    UK Offer Letter in 48 HoursThe law, passed by Congress in April, mandates that TikTok’s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divest the platform to an American entity or face a nationwide ban.
     TikTok, which boasts over <span class="million"> 70 million US users</span>, 1 has challenged the legislation, seeking to have it overturned.   
      If the Supreme Court upholds the law and ByteDance does not sell the app, TikTok could effectively be banned in the US by January 19.
    Trump’s current stance marks a notable shift from 2020, when he attempted to block TikTok in the US over concerns about its Chinese ownership. 
    His recent engagement with the platform signals a softer approach, including a December meeting with TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, during which Trump expressed a “warm spot” for the app.
